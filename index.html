		<h1>Snap Challenge - Data Design Reflection</h1>
		<dl>
			<dt><br>What is the most significant thing you have learned about object oriented?</dt>
			<dd>I have learned to look at websites in terms of individual objects.
				From a design stand point it is much easier to start in the object sense and work on one section at a time.  Something big and complicated is much easier to design when broken into chunks.<br></dd>
			<dt><br>What is the most significant thing you have learned about the effect of the frontend on the backend?</dt>
			<dd>I have learned that consistency is king!  Especially when naming class objects and state variables.  Also very important with namespaces and PDO statements.<br></dd>
			<dt><br>Why is encapsulation so important?</dt>
			<dd>It's important to hide values and states of structured data object inside a class which prevents unauthorized access.<br></dd>
			<dt><br>What is the air speed velocity of a laden swallow?</dt>
			<dd>African or European swallow? Roughly 25 miles an hour!</dd>
